## About Me

Hi! I'm Robert Harter. I am a senior at the University of Miami studying [bassoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassoon) performance at the Frost School of Music.
I am interested in learning to code as a means of creating useful and entertaining applications to aid in the teaching, learning, and practicing of music.
